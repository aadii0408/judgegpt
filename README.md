# 🏆 JudgeGPT – Autonomous Hackathon Evaluation Board

JudgeGPT is a multi-agent AI system that simulates a real hackathon judging panel.

It evaluates projects across technical depth, business impact, product design, risk, and innovation — and predicts failure risks before launch.

Instead of biased or rushed judging, JudgeGPT provides structured, multi-perspective evaluation powered by autonomous agents.

## 🚀 Why JudgeGPT?

In hackathons:
- Judging is subjective
- Technical depth gets missed
- Business viability isn’t fully analyzed
- Teams don’t know where they’ll lose points

JudgeGPT solves this by simulating a panel of specialized AI judges that independently evaluate and debate a project before generating a final verdict.

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture

JudgeGPT consists of specialized agents:

### 🧠 Technical Judge Agent
- Evaluates architecture
- Validates agent autonomy
- Checks tool usage
- Scores infra maturity

### 💰 Business Impact Agent
- Market size analysis
- Monetization clarity
- Real-world relevance
- Adoption feasibility

### 🎨 Product & UX Agent
- Usability
- Clarity
- Demo strength
- Presentation quality

### 🔐 Risk & Safety Agent
- Edge case detection
- Failure handling
- Security awareness
- Ethical implications

### 🚀 Innovation Agent
- Originality
- Differentiation
- Competitive uniqueness

### 🚨 Failure Prediction Agent
- Identifies weak execution assumptions
- Simulates 3–6 month outcome risks
- Predicts likely collapse points

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User submits:
   - Project summary
   - Architecture details
   - Demo transcript
   - Track selection

2. Coordinator Agent distributes context to judge agents

3. Each agent independently:
   - Scores the project
   - Provides reasoning
   - Flags weaknesses

4. Aggregator:
   - Combines scores
   - Resolves conflicts
   - Generates final verdict
   - Provides improvement roadmap

Optional: Roast Mode & Live Q&A simulation.

## 🔄 Example Output

Final Score: 7.8 / 10

Weakest Area:
- Failure recovery demonstration unclear

Strengths:
- Strong innovation
- Clear business application

Failure Risk Prediction:
- High risk at month 4 due to unrealistic CAC assumptions

Suggested Improvements:
- Add visible agent loop demo
- Show persistent memory
- Clarify monetization
